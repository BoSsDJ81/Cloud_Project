Notes

1. image:
scene0 is the base image.
Cat3 is of very high resolution. Therefore data is very large.
Data size is a funtion of image resolution. Image size can always be reduced during feature extraction to make data size small. 

2. data structure:
Two structures provided: XML and YML. Preliminary test shows XML requires lower memory.
Other test factors to be conducted to determine data structure choice:
 - Performance: encoding and decoding
 - Memory consumption
 - Expression clearity
 - Libary access/implementation
